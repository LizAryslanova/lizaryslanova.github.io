                    Hi, I'm Liz.

                    <br><br>


I am a self-taught machine learning engineer working freelance developing models for audio applications. <br><br>

Here are the links to the plugins that I worked on:

                <p id="aboutme">


I have a master's degree in Photonics and Optical Information Technology from ITMO University. My thesis was 'Numerical and analytical modeling of porous aluminum oxide growth as a matrix for metamaterial creation'. It is at the intersection of several fascinating fields: colloid and surface science, optics, and mathematical modeling.<br><br>

I continued my work in theoretical physics during postgraduate studies in Mathematical Modeling, Numerical Methods, and Software Solutions. After completing my coursework, I chose to leave before defending the Ph.D. thesis to pursue a career in learning and development and teaching mathematics.<br><br>

Since 2019, I have worked on creating over 15 online courses as a producer, editor, and curriculum consultant. The most enjoyable part for me was working with subject matter experts (SMEs) and creating a course structure to help learners have a more enriching experience. The experts know the subject really well. So well that the other can not imagine someone who is a novice. Developing a clear course structure that takes into account the knowledge level of the target audience is an important step. Bridging the gap between expert knowledge and novice learners by creating clear and accessible course structures has been the best part of the process, challenged only by the opportunities to learn directly from SMEs.<br><br>

In February 2023, I audited MIT's Machine Learning with Python-From Linear Models to Deep Learning (MITx 6.86x) course on edX.org. After that, I became captivated by Machine Learning and AI Technologies.
I am most interested in unsupervised models and audio-generative models.<br><br>

You can find my Instrument Classifier CNN model here: <a class="just-link" href="https://github.com/LizAryslanova/instrument_classifier"> GitHub project. </a> <br><br>

In my free time, I enjoy nature photography, DIY projects, and exploring neurobiology.
